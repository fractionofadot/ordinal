# Setup

- make sure you have a relatively up-to-date version of node installed on your machine
- cd into the client directory
- then use the following commands to get the dev server running:
```npm install```
wait for installation to finish then:
```npm start```
and you should see the server start up and it should autoopen a browser window to the served app
